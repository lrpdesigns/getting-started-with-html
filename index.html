<h1>The Basics of the Web & HTML</h1>

<b>Major Pieces of the Web</b>
<p>The web is a ton of computers that communicate with each other. When you go to a web page your computer sends a request to a server. The server finds the requested HTML document and sends it back to your computer, that then interprets the page and displays it on your screen.
</p>

<b>HTML - <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> </b>
<p>HTML documents are the most common form of content on the web. HTML documents are made up of:</p> <b>• text content</b> - what you see <br><b>•  markup</b> - how it looks <br><b>• reference to other docs</b> - e.g. images and videos<br><b>• links to other pages</b>
</p>

<b>HTML ATTRIBUTES/ELEMENTS</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML attributes and elements. When writing HTML, you can tell the browsers the type of element by using different "tags". <br><br><b>TYPES OF TAGS:</b><br>• Anchors - <em>(A)</em> Used for placing a link on your page. <br> • Images - <em>(IMG)</em> Used to place an image or photo onto your page. <br>• Whitespce - <em>(BR)</em> Used to create a break in any of your type. Another form of whitespace is <em>(P)</em> used to create paragraphs. 
</p>

<b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements have a sort of invisible box around the content inside of them allowing for more flexibility with the content they hold.
